# `Tests` folder

The `Tests` folder holds the `.http` test files, which can be grouped inside of subfolders. For the illustration purposes, the `Tests` folder holds two subfolders:

- [`Demos`](#demos-folder)
- [`Samples`](#samples-folder)

## [`Demos` folder](Demos)

The `Demos` folder contains several fully operational tests that can be used for demontrations and in presentations (for more information, see the [demo test documentation](Demos)).

## [`Samples` folder](Samples)

The `Samples` folder contains a fake example of a typical test suite covering CRUD operations against an imaginary REST API (for more information, see the [sample test documentation](Samples)).
