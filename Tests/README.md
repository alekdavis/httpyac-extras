# `Tests` folder

The `Tests` folder holds the `.http` test files, which can be grouped inside of subfolders. For the illustration purposes, the `Tests` folder holds two subfolders:

- `AdHoc`
- `Samples`

## [`AdHoc` folder](AdHoc)

The `AdHoc` folder contains several test files that use the public REST APIs published at [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/) to illustrate a few httpYac capabilities. All ad-hoc tests in this folder must be operational (you can run them as-is).

## [`Samples` folder](Samples)

The `Samples` folder contains a fake example of a typical test suite covering CRUD operations against an imaginary REST API. You can use this example as a reference, but keep in mind that as-is, they are not operational (you cannot run them until you make the required changes). For additional information about the samples, see [SAMPLES](SAMPLES.md).
