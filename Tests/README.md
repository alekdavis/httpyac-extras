# `Tests` folder

The `Tests` folder holds the `.http` test files, which can be grouped inside of subfolders. For the illustration purposes, the `Tests` folder holds two subfolders:

- `AdHoc`
- `Samples`

## [`AdHoc` folder](AdHoc)

The `AdHoc` folder contains several fully operational tests to illustrate a few httpYac capabilities (for more information, see the [ad-hoc test documentation](AdHoc)).

## [`Samples` folder](Samples)

The `Samples` folder contains a fake example of a typical test suite covering CRUD operations against an imaginary REST API (for more information, see the [sample test documentation](Samples)).
