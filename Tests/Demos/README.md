# `Demos` folder

The `Demos` folder contains several test files that use the public REST APIs published at [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/) to illustrate a few httpYac capabilities that could be helpful for demonstrations and presentations. Many of these tests are adopted from the official httpYac samples. The demo tests in this folder must be operational (you can run them as-is) with some exceptions (e.g. the authorization test example is marked as disabled because it uses fake information and would not work).
