# TIPS

## Check and keep versions up to date

Here are the commands to check the versions of node, npm, and httpyac:

```console
node -v
npm -v
httpyac --version
```

Here are the commands to install the latest versions of npm and httpyac CLI:

```console
npm install-g npm
npm update -g httpyac
```

If you want to update all versions of globally installed npm packages:

```console
npm update -g
```

NOTE: There are some [Windows quirks](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm#upgrading-on-windows) you need to be aware of. There are more [suggestions at StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18412129/how-can-i-update-npm-on-windows/31520672).
